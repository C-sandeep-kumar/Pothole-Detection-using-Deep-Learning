# Pothole-Detection-using-Deep-Learning
Pothole detection is a crucial aspect of road safety and infrastructure maintenance, as unattended road defects can lead to accidents, vehicle damage, and increased repair costs using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with pre-trained models such as ResNet50, ResNetV2, and VGG19 to automatically detect and classify potholes in road images
